## Introduction

The Image Caption Generator project creates descriptive captions for images using deep learning. By combining computer vision and natural language processing, it generates accurate, contextually relevant descriptions for visual content, improving accessibility, user experience, and cultural sensitivity.
## Features

- Object Detection: Uses pre-trained models (e.g., YOLO, Faster  R-CNN) for recognizing objects in images.

- Caption Generation: Employs sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms to create captions.

- Cultural Sensitivity: Focuses on reducing biases and stereotypes in generated captions.
## System Design

The project architecture consists of two main modules:

1. Image Detection: Extracts visual features from images using object detection and feature extraction techniques.

2. Caption Generation: Maps image features to descriptive captions using recurrent neural networks or transformer-based architectures with attention mechanisms.
## Usage

1. Prepare Dataset: Download and preprocess the dataset (e.g., COCO) for training.

2. Train Model: Train the image captioning model using the provided training scripts.

3. Generate Captions: Use the inference script to generate captions for new images.


## Result

1. Image Detection
The model detects and highlights objects in the image, forming the foundation for caption generation.

2. Caption Generation
Generated captions demonstrate high accuracy and contextual relevance, as shown in the examples:

    Input Image:
    Generated Caption: "A cat sitting on a couch."
